# Matching Harry Potter Spells To Their Definitions

## Brief overview 
This project is an analysis of Word2Vec and GloVe vectors, in which their
ability to make "novel" ideas is tested. This is performed in creating Harry
Potter spells from definition. 

## How are Harry Potter spells made and evaluation of new spells.  
Harry Potter Spells are based on a word/words being translated from English to
another language. As a result, word embeddings can be tested to see what words
they can generate from a given definition to see if they came with a new word
from a definition or whether the new word is contained within the definition. If
so, the word itself might as well have been picked randomly from the
definition. This project evaluates how sucessful Word2Vec and GloVe is.
